<p><em>Time axis creation/manipulation for charts</em></p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Generate the values for time series chart axis</li>
<li>Allows for custom granularities like release/iteration/iteration_day</li>
<li>Knockout weekends and holidays (ChartTimeIterator)</li>
<li>Knockout non-work hours (ChartTimeIterator)</li>
<li>Drill up and down granularity</li>
<li>Work with precision around timezone differences</li>
<li>Month is 1-indexed instead of 0-indexed like Javascript's Date object</li>
<li>Date/Time math (add 3 months, subtract 2 weeks, etc.)</li>
<li>Tested</li>
<li>Documented</li>
</ul>

<h2>Granularity</h2>

<p>Each ChartTime object has a granularity. This means that you never have to
worry about any bits lower than your specified granularity. A day has only
year, month, and day segments. You are never tempted to specify 11:59pm
to specify the end of a day-long timebox.</p>

<p>ChartTime supports the following granularities:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>year</code>
<ul><li><code>month</code>
<ul><li><code>day</code>
<ul><li><code>hour</code>
<ul><li><code>minute</code>
<ul><li><code>second</code>
<ul><li><code>millisecond</code></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li><code>quarter</code> (but not quarter_month, day, etc.)</li>
<li><code>week</code> (ISO-8601 style week numbering)
<ul><li><code>week_day</code> (Monday = 1, Sunday = 7)</li></ul></li></ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Also, you can define your own custom hierarchical granularities, for example...</p>

<ul>
<li><code>release</code>
<ul><li><code>iteration</code>
<ul><li><code>iteration_day</code></li></ul></li></ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Timezone precision</h2>

<p>It's very hard to do filtering and grouping of time-series data with timezone precision. </p>

<p>For instance, 11pm in California on December 25 (Christmas holiday) is 2am December 26 (not a holiday)
in New York. This also happens to be 7am December 26 GMT. If you have an event that occurs at 
2011-12-26T07:00:00.000Z, then you need to decide what timezone to use as your context before you 
decide if that event occured on Christmas day or not. It's not just holidays where this can burn you.
Deciding if a piece of work finished in one iteration versus another can make a difference for
you iteration metrics. The iteration metrics for a distributed team should look the same regardless
of whether those metrics were generated in New York versus Los Angeles... versus Bangalore.</p>

<p>The javascript Date object lets you work in either the local time or Zulu (GMT/UTC) time but it doesn't let you
control the timezone. Do you know the correct way to apply the timezone shift to a JavaScript Date Object? 
Do you know when Daylight Savings Time kicks in and New York is 4 hours shifted from GMT instead of 5? Will
you remember to do it perfectly every time it's needed in your code?</p>

<p>If you need this precision, ChartTime helps by clearly delineating the moment when you need to do 
timezone manipulation... the moment you need to compare two or more dates. You can do all of your
holiday/weekend knockout manipulation without regard to timezone and only consider the timezone
upon comparison. </p>

<h2>Month is 1-indexed as you would expect</h2>

<p>Javascript's date object uses 0 for January and 11 for December. ChartTime uses 1 for January and 12 for December...
which is what ISO-8601 uses and what humans expect. Everyone who works with the javascript Date Object at one
point or another gets burned by this.</p>

<h2>Week support</h2>

<p>ChartTime follows ISO-8601 where ever it makes sense. Implications of using this ISO format (paraphrased info from wikipedia):</p>

<ul>
<li>All weeks have 7 days (i.e. there are no fractional weeks).</li>
<li>Any given day falls into a single week which means that incrementing across the year boundary in week
granularity is without gaps or repeats.</li>
<li>Weeks are contained within a single year. (i.e. weeks are never spit over two years).</li>
<li>The above two implications also mean that we have to warp the boundaries of the year to accomplish this. In week
granularity dates may appear in a different year than you would expect and some years have 53 weeks.</li>
<li>The date directly tells the weekday.</li>
<li>All years start with a Monday and end with a Sunday.</li>
<li>Dates represented as yyyyWww-d can be sorted as strings.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>In general, it just greatly simplifies the use of week granularity in a chart situation.</strong></p>

<p>The only real downside to this approach is that USA folks expect the week to start on Sunday. However, the ISO-8601 spec starts
each week on Monday. Following ISO-8601, ChartTime uses 1 for Monday and 7 for Sunday which aligns with
the US standard for every day except Sunday. The US standard is to use 0 for Sunday.</p>

<h2>Basic usage</h2>

<pre><code>{ChartTimeIterator, ChartTimeRange, ChartTime} = require('../')

d1 = new ChartTime({granularity: 'day', year: 2011, month: 2, day: 28})
console.log(d1.toString())
# 2011-02-28
</code></pre>

<p>You can use the string short-hand rather than spell out the segments seperately. The granularity
is automatically inferred from how many segments you provide.</p>

<pre><code>d2 = new ChartTime('2011-03-01')
console.log(d2.toString())
# 2011-03-01
</code></pre>

<p>Increment/decrement and compare ChartTimes without regard to timezone</p>

<pre><code>console.log(d1.$gte(d2)) 
d1.increment()
console.log(d1.$eq(d2))
# false
# true
</code></pre>

<p>Do math on them.</p>

<pre><code>d3 = d1.add(5)
console.log(d3.toString())
# 2011-03-06
</code></pre>

<p>Get the day of the week.</p>

<pre><code>console.log(d3.dowString())
# Sunday
</code></pre>

<p>Subtraction is just addition with negative numbers.</p>

<pre><code>d3.addInPlace(-6)
console.log(d3.toString())
# 2011-02-28
</code></pre>

<p>If you start on the last day of a month, adding a month takes you to the last day of the next month, 
even if the number of days are different.</p>

<pre><code>d3.addInPlace(1, 'month')  
console.log(d3.toString())
# 2011-03-31
</code></pre>

<p>Deals well with year-granularity math and leap year complexity.</p>

<pre><code>d4 = new ChartTime('2004-02-29')  # leap day
d4.addInPlace(1, 'year')  # adding a year takes us to a non-leap year
console.log(d4.toString())
# 2005-02-28
</code></pre>

<p>Week granularity correctly wraps and deals with 53-week years.</p>

<pre><code>w1 = new ChartTime('2004W53-6')
console.log(w1.inGranularity('day').toString())
# 2005-01-01
</code></pre>

<p>Convert between any of the standard granularities. Also converts custom granularities (not shown) to
standard granularities if you provide a <code>rataDieNumber()</code> function with your custom granularities.</p>

<pre><code>d5 = new ChartTime('2005-01-01')  # goes the other direction also
console.log(d5.inGranularity('week_day').toString())
# 2004W53-6

q1 = new ChartTime('2011Q3')
console.log(q1.inGranularity('millisecond').toString())
# 2011-07-01T00:00:00.000
</code></pre>

<h2>Timezones</h2>

<p>ChartTime does timezone sensitive conversions. You must set the path to the tz files before doing any timezone sensitive comparisons.
Note, if you are using one of the pre-packaged Lumenize.js or Lumenize-min.js, then you can supply any string in this call. It will
ignore what you provide and load the time zone data from the files included in the package. We would like to remove the requirement
for this initialization when running one of these packages, but for now, you still need the dummy call.</p>

<pre><code>ChartTime.setTZPath('../vendor/tz')

console.log(new ChartTime('2011-01-01').getJSDate('America/Denver').toUTCString())
# Sat, 01 Jan 2011 07:00:00 GMT

                  <p>addGranularity allows you to add your own hierarchical granularities to ChartTime. Once you add a granularity to ChartTime
you can then instantiate ChartTime objects in your newly specified granularity. You specify new granularities with 
granularitySpec object like this:</p>

<pre><code>granularitySpec = {
  release: {
    segments: ['release'],
    mask: 'R##',
    lowest: 1,
    dayPastEnd: new ChartTime('2011-07-01')

      return ChartTime.granularitySpecs.iteration.timeBoxes.length + 1  # Yes, it's correct to use the length of iteration.timeBoxes
    rataDieNumber: (ct) -&gt;
      return ChartTime.granularitySpecs.iteration.timeBoxes[ct.release-1][1-1].start.rataDieNumber()
  },
  iteration: {
    segments: ['release', 'iteration'],
    mask: 'R##I##',
    lowest: 1,
    dayPastEnd: new ChartTime('2011-07-01')        
    timeBoxes: [
      [
        {start: new ChartTime('2011-01-01'), label: 'R1 Iteration 1'},
        {start: new ChartTime('2011-02-01'), label: 'R1 Iteration 2'},
        {start: new ChartTime('2011-03-01'), label: 'R1 Iteration 3'},
      ],
      [
        {start: new ChartTime('2011-04-01'), label: 'R2 Iteration 1'},
        {start: new ChartTime('2011-05-01'), label: 'R2 Iteration 2'},
        {start: new ChartTime('2011-06-01'), label: 'R2 Iteration 3'},
      ]
    ]
    pastHighest: (ct) -&gt;
      temp = ChartTime.granularitySpecs.iteration.timeBoxes[ct.release-1]?.length + 1
      if temp? and not isNaN(temp) and ct.beforePastFlag != 'PAST_LAST'
        return temp
      else
        numberOfReleases = ChartTime.granularitySpecs.iteration.timeBoxes.length
        return ChartTime.granularitySpecs.iteration.timeBoxes[numberOfReleases-1].length + 1

    rataDieNumber: (ct) -&gt;
      return ChartTime.granularitySpecs.iteration.timeBoxes[ct.release-1][ct.iteration-1].start.rataDieNumber()
  },
  iteration_day: {  # By convention, it knows to use day functions on it. This is the lowest allowed custom granularity
    segments: ['release', 'iteration', 'iteration_day'],
    mask: 'R##I##-##',
    lowest: 1,
    dayPastEnd: new ChartTime('2011-07-01'),
    pastHighest: (ct) -&gt;
      iterationTimeBox = ChartTime.granularitySpecs.iteration.timeBoxes[ct.release-1]?[ct.iteration-1]
      if !iterationTimeBox? or ct.beforePastFlag == 'PAST_LAST'
        numberOfReleases = ChartTime.granularitySpecs.iteration.timeBoxes.length
        numberOfIterationsInLastRelease = ChartTime.granularitySpecs.iteration.timeBoxes[numberOfReleases-1].length
        iterationTimeBox = ChartTime.granularitySpecs.iteration.timeBoxes[numberOfReleases-1][numberOfIterationsInLastRelease-1]

      thisIteration = iterationTimeBox.start.inGranularity('iteration')
      nextIteration = thisIteration.add(1)
      if nextIteration.beforePastFlag == 'PAST_LAST'
        return ChartTime.granularitySpecs.iteration_day.dayPastEnd.rataDieNumber() - iterationTimeBox.start.rataDieNumber() + 1
      else
        return nextIteration.rataDieNumber() - iterationTimeBox.start.rataDieNumber() + 1 

    rataDieNumber: (ct) -&gt;
      return ChartTime.granularitySpecs.iteration.timeBoxes[ct.release-1][ct.iteration-1].start.rataDieNumber() + ct.iteration_day - 1
  }
}    
ChartTime.addGranularity(granularitySpec)
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>mask</code> must cover all of the segments to get down to the granularity being specified. The digits of the granularity segments
are represented with <code>#</code>. Any other characters can be used as a delimeter, but it should always be one character to comply with 
the expectations of the Lumenize hierarchy visualizations. All of the standard granularities start with a 4-digit year to
distinguish your custom granularity, your highest level must start with some number of digits other than 4 or a prefix letter 
(<code>R</code> in the example above).</p>

<p>In order for the ChartTimeIterator to work, you must provide <code>pastHighest</code> and <code>rataDieNumber</code> callback functions. You should
be able to mimic (or use as-is) the example above for most use cases. Notice how the <code>rataDieNumber</code> function simply leverages
<code>rataDieNumber</code> functions for the standard granularities.</p>

<p>In order to convert into this granularity from some other granularity, you must provide an <code>inGranularity</code> callback [NOT YET IMPLEMENTED].
But ChartTime will convert to any of the standard granularities from even custom granularities as long as a <code>rataDieNumber()</code> function
is provided.</p>

<p><strong>The <code>timeBoxes</code> propoerty in the <code>granularitySpec</code> Object above has no special meaning</strong> to ChartTime or ChartTimeIterator. It's simply used
by the <code>pastHighest</code> and <code>rataDieNumber</code> functions. The boundaries could come from where ever you want and even have been encoded as
literals in the <code>pastHighest</code> and <code>rataDieNumber</code> callback functions.</p>

<p>The convention of naming the lowest order granularity with <code>_day</code> at the end IS signficant. ChartTime knows to treat that as a day-level
granularity. If there is a use-case for it, ChartTime could be upgraded to allow you to drill down into hours, minutes, etc. from any
<code>_day</code> granularity but right now those lower order time granularities are only supported for the canonical ISO-6801 form.</p>

                  <h4>constructor(spec_RDN_Date_Or_String, granularity, tz)</h4>
                  <p>The constructor for ChartTime supports the passing in of a String, a rata die number (RDN), or a spec Object</p>

<h2>String</h2>

<p>When you pass in a <strong>String</strong>, ChartTime uses the masks that are defined for each granularity to figure out the granularity...
unless you explicitly provide a granularity. This parser does not work on all valid ISO-8601 forms. Ordinal dates are not 
supported at all but week number form (<code>"2009W52-7"</code>) is supported. The canonical form (<code>"2009-01-01T12:34:56.789"</code>) will work
as will any shortened subset of it (<code>"2009-01-01"</code>, <code>"2009-01-01T12:34"</code>, etc.). We've added a form for Quarter
granularity (<code>"2009Q4"</code>). Plus it will even parse strings in whatever custom granularity you provide based
upon the mask that you provide for that granularity.</p>

<p>If the granularity is specified but not all of the segments are provided, ChartTime will fill in the missing value 
with the <code>lowest</code> value from granularitySpecs.</p>

<p>The Lumenize hierarchy tools rely upon the property that a single character is used between segments so the ISO forms that 
omit the delimeters are not supported.</p>

<p>If the string has a timezone indicator on the end (<code>...+05:00</code> or <code>...Z</code>), ChartTime will ignore it. Timezone information
is intended to only be used for comparison (see examples for timezone comparison).</p>

<p>There are two special Strings that are recognized: <code>BEFORE_FIRST</code> and <code>PAST_LAST</code>. You must provide a granularity if you
are instantiating a ChartTime with these values. They are primarily used for custom granularities where your users
may mistakenly request charts for iterations and releases that have not yet been defined. They are particularly useful when 
you want to iterate to the last defined iteration/release.</p>

<h2>Rata Die Number</h2>

<p>The <strong>rata die number (RDN)</strong> for a date is the number of days since 0001-01-01. You will probably never work
directly with this number but it's what ChartTime uses to convert between granularities. When you are instantiating
a ChartTime from an RDN, you must provide a granularity. Using RDN will work even for the granularities finer than day.
ChartTime will populate the finer grained segments (hour, minute, etc.) with the approriate <code>lowest</code> value.</p>

<h2>Date</h2>

<p>You can also pass in a JavaScript Date() Object. The passing in of a tz with this option doesn't make sense. You'll end
up with the same ChartTime value no matter what because the JS Date() already sorta has a timezone. I'm not sure if this
option is even really useful. In most cases, you are probably better off using ChartTime.getZuluString()</p>

<h2>Spec</h2>

<p>You can also explicitly spell out the segments in a <strong>spec</strong> Object in the form of 
<code>{granularity: 'day', year: 2009, month: 1, day: 1}</code>. If the granularity is specified but not all of the segments are 
provided, ChartTime will fill in the missing value with the appropriate <code>lowest</code> value from granularitySpecs.</p>

<h2>granularity</h2>

<p>If you provide a granularity it will take precedence over whatever fields you've provided in your spec or whatever segments
you have provided in your string. ChartTime will leave off extra values and fill in missing ones with the appropriate <code>lowest</code>
value.</p>

<h2>tz</h2>

<p>Most of the time, ChartTime assumes that any dates you pass in are timezone less. You'll specify Christmas as 12-25, then you'll
shift the boundaries of Christmas for a specific timezone for boundary comparison.</p>

<p>However, if you provide a tz parameter to this constructor, ChartTime will assume you are passing in a true GMT date/time and shift into 
the provided timezone. So...</p>

<pre><code>d = new ChartTime('2011-01-01T02:00:00:00.000Z', 'day', 'America/New_York')
console.log(d.toString())
# 2010-12-31
</code></pre>

<p>Rule of thumb on when you want to use timezones:</p>

<ol>
<li>If you have true GMT date/times and you want to create a ChartTime, provide the timezone to this constructor.</li>
<li>If you have abstract days like Christmas or June 10th and you want to delay the timezone consideration, don't provide a timezone to this constructor.</li>
<li>In either case, if the dates you want to compare to are in GMT, but you've got ChartTimes or ChartTimeRanges, you'll have to provide a timezone on
the way back out of ChartTime/ChartTimeRange</li>
</ol>

                <div class="method">
                  <h4>granularityAboveDay()</h4>

                  <p>Returns a JavaScript Date Object properly shifted. This Date Object can be compared to other Date Objects that you know
are already in the desired timezone. If you have data that comes from an API in GMT. You can first create a ChartTime object from
it and then (using this getJSDate() function) you can compare it to JavaScript Date Objects created in local time.</p>

<p>The full name of this function should be getJSDateInGMTasummingThisCTDateIsInTimezone(tz). It converts <strong>TO</strong> GMT 
(actually something that can be compared to GMT). It does <strong>NOT</strong> convert <strong>FROM</strong> GMT. Use getJSDateInTZfromGMT()
if you want to go in the other direction.</p>

<p>Note, you must set the path to the tz files with <code>ChartTime.setTZPath('path/to/tz/files')</code> before you do timezone 
sensitive comparisions.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

console.log(ct.getJSDate('GMT').getTime() == d.getTime())

it into the specified timezone.</p>

<p>Note, this function will be off by an hour for the times near midnight on the days where there is a shift to/from daylight 
savings time. The tz rules engine is designed to go in the other direction so we're mis-using it and will be using the wrong
moment in rules-space for that hour. The cost of fixing this issue was deamed to high for chart applications.</p>
