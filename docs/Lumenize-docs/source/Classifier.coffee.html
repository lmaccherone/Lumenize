   * 
   * __A Bayesian classifier with non-parametric modeling of distributions using v-optimal bucketing.__
   * 
   * If you look for libraries for Bayesian classification, the primary use case is spam filtering and they assume that
   * the presence or absence of a word is the only feature you are interested in. This is a more general purpose tool.
   * 
   * ## Features ##
   * 
   * * Works even for bi-modal and other non-normal distributions
   * * No requirement that you identify the distribution
   * * Uses [non-parametric modeling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-parametric_statistics)
   * * Uses v-optimal bucketing so it deals well with outliers and sharp cliffs
   * * Serialize (`getStateForSaving()`) and deserialize (`newFromSavedState()`) to preserve training between sessions
   * 
   * ## Why the assumption of a normal distribution is bad in some cases ##
   * 
   * The [wikipedia example of using Bayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier#Sex_classification) tries
   * to determine if someone was male or female based upon the height, weight
   * and shoe size. The assumption is that men are generally larger, heavier, and have larger shoe size than women. In the
   * example, they use the mean and variance of the male-only and female-only populations to characterize those
   * distributions. This works because these characteristics are generally normally distributed **and the distribution for
   * men is generally to the right of the distribution for women**.
   * 
   * However, let&#39;s ask a group of folks who work together if they consider themselves a team and let&#39;s try to use the size
   * of the group as a feature to predict what a new group would say. If the group is very small (1-2 people), they are
   * less likely to consider themselves a team (partnership maybe), but if they are too large (say &gt; 10), they are also
   * unlikely to refer to themselves as a team. The non-team distribution is bimodal, looking at its mean and variance
   * completely mis-characterizes it. Also, the distribution is zero bound so it&#39;s likely to be asymmetric, which also
   * poses problems for a normal distribution assumption.
   * 
   * ## So what do we do instead? ##
   * 
   * This classifier uses the actual sampled percentage for buckets of the data. This approach is often referred to
   * as &quot;building a non-parametric model&quot;, although &quot;distribution-free&quot; strikes me a better label.
   * 
   * **Pros/Cons**. The use of a non-parametric approach will allow us to deal with non-normal distributions (asymmetric,
   * bimodal, etc.) without ever having to identify which nominal distribution is the best fit or having to ask the user
   * (who may not know) what distribution to use. The downside to this approach is that it generally requires a larger
   * training set. You will need to experiment to determine how small is too small for your situation.
   * 
   * This approach is hinted at in the [wikipedia article on Bayesian classifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier)
   * as &quot;binning to discretize the feature values, to obtain a new set of Bernoulli-distributed features&quot;. However, this
   * classifier does not create new separate Bernoulli features for each bin. Rather, it creates a mapping function from a feature
   * value to a probability indicating how often the feature value is coincident with a particular outputField value. This mapping
   * function is different for each bin.
   * 
   * ## V-optimal bucketing ##
   * 
   * There are two common approaches to bucketing:
   * 
   * 1. Make each bucket be equal in width along the x-axis (like we would for a histogram) (equi-width)
   * 2. Make each bucket have roughly the same number of data points (equi-depth)
   * 
   * It turns out neither of the above works out well for this use case. Rather, there is an approach called [v-optimal
   * bucketing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-optimal_histograms) which attempts to find the optimal boundaries in the
   * data. The basic idea is to look for the splits that
   * provide the minimum total error-squared where the &quot;error&quot; for each point is the distance of that point from the
   * arithmetic mean.
   * 
   * The algorithm used here for v-optimal bucketing is slightly inspired by
   * [this non-recursive code](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~cheung/Courses/584-StreamDB/Syllabus/06-Histograms/v-opt3.html).
   * However, the implementation here is recursive and I&#39;ve made some different choices about when to terminate the splitting. To
   * understand the essence of the algorithm used, you need only look at the 9 lines of code in the `findBucketSplits()` function.
   * The `optimalSplitFor2Buckets()` function will split the values into two buckets. It tries each possible split
   * starting with only one in the bucket on the left all the way down to a split with only one in the bucket on the right.
   * 
   * ## Simple example ##
   * 
   * First we need to require the classifier.
   * 
   *     {BayesianClassifier} = require(&#39;../&#39;)
   * 
   * Before we start, let&#39;s take a look at our training set. The assumption is that we think TeamSize and HasChildProject
   * will be predictors for RealTeam.
   * 
   *     trainingSet = [
   *       {TeamSize: 5, HasChildProject: 0, RealTeam: 1},
   *       {TeamSize: 3, HasChildProject: 1, RealTeam: 0},
   *       {TeamSize: 3, HasChildProject: 1, RealTeam: 1},
   *       {TeamSize: 1, HasChildProject: 0, RealTeam: 0},
   *       {TeamSize: 2, HasChildProject: 1, RealTeam: 0},
   *       {TeamSize: 2, HasChildProject: 0, RealTeam: 0},
   *       {TeamSize: 15, HasChildProject: 1, RealTeam: 0},
   *       {TeamSize: 27, HasChildProject: 1, RealTeam: 0},
   *       {TeamSize: 13, HasChildProject: 1, RealTeam: 1},
   *       {TeamSize: 7, HasChildProject: 0, RealTeam: 1},
   *       {TeamSize: 7, HasChildProject: 0, RealTeam: 0},
   *       {TeamSize: 9, HasChildProject: 1, RealTeam: 1},
   *       {TeamSize: 6, HasChildProject: 0, RealTeam: 1},
   *       {TeamSize: 5, HasChildProject: 0, RealTeam: 1},
   *       {TeamSize: 5, HasChildProject: 0, RealTeam: 0},
   *     ]
   * 
   * Now, let&#39;s set up a simple config indicating our assumptions. Note how the type for TeamSize is &#39;continuous&#39;
   * whereas the type for HasChildProject is &#39;discrete&#39; eventhough a number is stored. Continuous types must be numbers
   * but discrete types can either be numbers or strings.
   * 
   *     config =
   *       outputField: &quot;RealTeam&quot;
   *       features: [
   *         {field: &#39;TeamSize&#39;, type: &#39;continuous&#39;},
   *         {field: &#39;HasChildProject&#39;, type: &#39;discrete&#39;}
   *       ]
   * 
   * We can now instantiate the classifier with that config,
   * 
   *     classifier = new BayesianClassifier(config)
   * 
   * and pass in our training set.
   * 
   *     percentWins = classifier.train(trainingSet)
   * 
   * The call to `train()` returns the percentage of times that the trained classifier gets the right answer for the training
   * set. This should usually be pretty high. Anything below say, 70% and you probably don&#39;t have the right &quot;features&quot;
   * in your training set or you don&#39;t have enough training set data. Our made up exmple is a borderline case.
   * 
   *     console.log(percentWins)
   *     # 0.7333333333333333
   * 
   * Now, let&#39;s see how the trained classifier is used to predict &quot;RealTeam&quot;-ness. We simply pass in an object with
   * fields for each of our features. A very small team with child projects are definitely not a RealTeam.
   * 
   *     console.log(classifier.predict({TeamSize: 1, HasChildProject: 1}))
   *     # 0
   * 
   * However, a mid-sized project with no child projects most certainly is a RealTeam.
   * 
   *     console.log(classifier.predict({TeamSize: 7, HasChildProject: 0}))
   *     # 1
   * 
   * Here is a less obvious case, with one indicator going one way (too big) and another going the other way (no child projects).
   * 
   *     console.log(classifier.predict({TeamSize: 29, HasChildProject: 0}))
   *     # 0
   * 
   * If you want to know the strength of the prediction, you can pass in `true` as the second parameter to the `predict()` method.
   * 
   *     console.log(classifier.predict({TeamSize: 29, HasChildProject: 0}, true))
   *     # { &#39;0&#39;: 0.6956521739130435, &#39;1&#39;: 0.30434782608695654 }
   * 
   * We&#39;re only 69.6% sure this is not a RealTeam. Notice how the keys for the output are strings eventhough we passed in values
   * of type Number for the RealTeam field in our training set. We had no choice in this case because keys of JavaScript
   * Objects must be strings. However, the classifier is smart enough to know that you wanted
   * 
   * Like the Lumenize calculators, you can save and restore the state of a trained classifier.
   * 
   *     savedState = classifier.getStateForSaving(&#39;some meta data&#39;)
   *     newClassifier = BayesianClassifier.newFromSavedState(savedState)
   *     console.log(newClassifier.meta)
   *     # some meta data
   * 
   * It will make the same predictions.
   * 
   *     console.log(newClassifier.predict({TeamSize: 29, HasChildProject: 0}, true))
   *     # { &#39;0&#39;: 0.6956521739130435, &#39;1&#39;: 0.30434782608695654 }

   *  fields as &#39;discrete&#39;. It is preferable to do this if you know that it can only be one of a hand full of values
   *  (0 vs 1 for example).
