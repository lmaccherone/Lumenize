   * 
   * _Time axis creation/manipulation for charts_
   * 
   * ## Features ##
   * 
   * * Generate the values for time series chart axis
   * * Knockout weekends and holidays (ChartTimeIterator)
   * * Knockout non-work hours (ChartTimeIterator)
   * * Work with precision around timezone differences
   * * Month is 1-indexed (rather than 0-indexed like Javascript's Date object)
   * * Date/Time math (add 3 months, subtract 2 weeks, etc.)
   * * Work with ISO-8601 formatted strings (called 'ISOString' in this library)
   *    * Added: Quarter form (e.g. 2012Q3 equates to 2012-07-01)
   *    * Not supported: Ordinal form (e.g. 2012-001 for 2012-01-01, 2011-365 for 2012-12-31) not supported
   * * Allows for custom granularities like release/iteration/iteration_day
   * * Tested
   * * Documented
   * 
   * ## Granularity ##
   * 
   * Each ChartTime object has a granularity. This means that you never have to
   * worry about any bits lower than your specified granularity. A day has only
   * year, month, and day segments. You are never tempted to specify 11:59pm
   * to specify the end of a day-long timebox.
   * 
   * ChartTime supports the following granularities:
   * 
   * * `year`
   *     * `month`
   *         * `day`
   *             * `hour`
   *                * `minute`
   *                    * `second`
   *                        * `millisecond`
   *     * `quarter` (but not quarter_month, day, etc.)
   *     * `week` (ISO-8601 style week numbering)
   *        * `week_day` (Monday = 1, Sunday = 7)
   * 
   * Also, you can define your own custom hierarchical granularities, for example...
   * 
   * * `release`
   *    * `iteration`
   *       * `iteration_day`
   *   
   * ## Timezone precision ##
   * 
   * It's very hard to do filtering and grouping of time-series data with timezone precision. 
   * 
   * For instance, 11pm in California on December 25 (Christmas holiday) is 2am December 26 (not a holiday)
   * in New York. This also happens to be 7am December 26 GMT. If you have an event that occurs at 
   * 2011-12-26T07:00:00.000Z, then you need to decide what timezone to use as your context before you 
   * decide if that event occured on Christmas day or not. It's not just holidays where this can burn you.
   * Deciding if a piece of work finished in one time range versus another can make a difference for
   * you metrics. The time range metrics for a distributed team should look the same regardless
   * of whether those metrics were generated in New York versus Los Angeles... versus Bangalore.
   * 
   * The javascript Date object lets you work in either the local time or Zulu (GMT/UTC) time but it doesn't let you
   * control the timezone. Do you know the correct way to apply the timezone shift to a JavaScript Date Object? 
   * Do you know when Daylight Savings Time kicks in and New York is 4 hours shifted from GMT instead of 5? Will
   * you remember to do it perfectly every time it's needed in your code?
   * 
   * If you need this precision, ChartTime helps by clearly delineating the moment when you need to do 
   * timezone manipulation... the moment you need to compare/query timestamped data. You can do all of your
   * holiday/weekend knockout manipulation without regard to timezone and only consider the timezone
   * upon query submission or comparison.
   * 
   * ## Month is 1-indexed as you would expect ##
   * 
   * Javascript's date object uses 0 for January and 11 for December. ChartTime uses 1 for January and 12 for December...
   * which is what ISO-8601 uses and what humans expect. Everyone who works with the javascript Date Object at one
   * point or another gets burned by this.
   * 
   * ## Week support ##
   * 
   * ChartTime follows ISO-8601 week support where ever it makes sense. Implications of using this ISO format (paraphrased
   * info from wikipedia):
   * 
   * * All weeks have 7 days (i.e. there are no fractional weeks).
   * * Any given day falls into a single week which means that incrementing across the year boundary in week
   *   granularity is without gaps or repeats.
   * * Weeks are contained within a single year. (i.e. weeks are never spit over two years).
   * * The above two implications also mean that we have to warp the boundaries of the year to accomplish this. In week
   *   granularity dates may appear in a different year than you would expect and some years have 53 weeks.
   * * The date directly tells the weekday.
   * * All years start with a Monday and end with a Sunday.
   * * Dates represented as yyyyWww-d can be sorted as strings.
   * 
   * **In general, it just greatly simplifies the use of week granularity in a chart situation.**
   * 
   * The only real downside to this approach is that USA folks expect the week to start on Sunday. However, the ISO-8601 spec starts
   * each week on Monday. Following ISO-8601, ChartTime uses 1 for Monday and 7 for Sunday which aligns with
   * the US standard for every day except Sunday. The US standard is to use 0 for Sunday.
   * 
   * ## Basic usage ##
   * 
   *     {ChartTimeIterator, ChartTimeRange, ChartTime} = require('../')
   * 
   * Get ChartTime objects relative to now.
   * 
   *     d = new ChartTime('this millisecond in Pacific/Fiji')
   *     d = new ChartTime('previous week')
   *     d = new ChartTime('next month')
   *     
   * Spell it all out with a JavaScript object
   * 
   *     d1 = new ChartTime({granularity: ChartTime.DAY, year: 2011, month: 2, day: 28})
   *     console.log(d1.toString())
   *     # 2011-02-28
   *     
   * You can use the string short-hand rather than spell out the segments separately. The granularity
   * is automatically inferred from how many segments you provide.
   * 
   *     d2 = new ChartTime('2011-03-01')
   *     console.log(d2.toString())
   *     # 2011-03-01
   *     
   * Increment/decrement and compare ChartTimes without regard to timezone
   * 
   *     console.log(d1.greaterThanOrEqual(d2))
   *     d1.increment()
   *     console.log(d1.equal(d2))
   *     # false
   *     # true
   * 
   * Do math on them.
   *     
   *     d3 = d1.add(5)
   *     console.log(d3.toString())
   *     # 2011-03-06
   * 
   * Get the day of the week.
   * 
   *     console.log(d3.dowString())
   *     # Sunday
   *     
   * Subtraction is just addition with negative numbers.
   * 
   *     d3.addInPlace(-6)
   *     console.log(d3.toString())
   *     # 2011-02-28
   * 
   * If you start on the last day of a month, adding a month takes you to the last day of the next month, 
   * even if the number of days are different.
   *     
   *     d3.addInPlace(1, 'month')  
   *     console.log(d3.toString())
   *     # 2011-03-31
   *     
   * Deals well with year-granularity math and leap year complexity.
   * 
   *     d4 = new ChartTime('2004-02-29')  # leap day
   *     d4.addInPlace(1, 'year')  # adding a year takes us to a non-leap year
   *     console.log(d4.toString())
   *     # 2005-02-28
   *     
   * Week granularity correctly wraps and deals with 53-week years.
   * 
   *     w1 = new ChartTime('2004W53-6')
   *     console.log(w1.inGranularity(ChartTime.DAY).toString())
   *     # 2005-01-01
   *     
   * Convert between any of the standard granularities. Also converts custom granularities (not shown) to
   * standard granularities if you provide a `rataDieNumber()` function with your custom granularities.
   * 
   *     d5 = new ChartTime('2005-01-01')  # goes the other direction also
   *     console.log(d5.inGranularity('week_day').toString())
   *     # 2004W53-6
   *     
   *     q1 = new ChartTime('2011Q3')
   *     console.log(q1.inGranularity(ChartTime.MILLISECOND).toString())
   *     # 2011-07-01T00:00:00.000
   *     
   * ## Timezones ##
   * 
   * ChartTime does timezone sensitive conversions. You must set the path to the tz files before doing any timezone sensitive comparisons.
   * Note, if you are using one of the pre-packaged Lumenize.js or Lumenize-min.js, then you can supply any string in this call. It will
   * ignore what you provide and load the time zone data from the files included in the package. We would like to remove the requirement
   * for this initialization when running one of these packages, but for now, you still need the dummy call.
   * 
   *     console.log(new ChartTime('2011-01-01').getJSDate('America/Denver').toUTCString())
   *     # Sat, 01 Jan 2011 07:00:00 GMT
   * 
   * @constructor
   * @param {Object/Number/Date/String} value
   * @param {String} [granularity]
   * @param {String} [tz]
   * 
   * The constructor for ChartTime supports the passing in of a String, a rata die number (RDN), or a spec Object
   * 
   * ## String ##
   * 
   * There are two kinds of strings that can be passed into the constructor:
   * 
   * 1. Human strings relative to now (e.g. &quot;this day&quot;, &quot;previous month&quot;, &quot;next quarter&quot;, &quot;this millisecond in Pacific/Fiji&quot;, etc.)
   * 2. ISO-8601 or custom masked (e.g. &quot;I03D10&quot; - 10th day of 3rd iteration)
   * 
   * ## Human strings relative to now ##
   * 
   * The string must be in the form `(this, previous, next) |granularity| [in |timezone|]`
   * 
   * Examples
   * 
   * * `this day` today
   * * `next month` next month
   * * `this day in Pacific/Fiji` the day that it currently is in Fiji
   * * `previous hour in America/New_York` the hour before the current hour in New York
   * * `next quarter` next quarter
   * * `previous week` last week
   * 
   * ## ISO-8601 or custom masked ##
   * 
   * When you pass in an ISO-8601 or custom mask string, ChartTime uses the masks that are defined for each granularity to figure out the granularity...
   * unless you explicitly provide a granularity. This parser does not work on all valid ISO-8601 forms. Ordinal dates (`&quot;2012-288&quot;`)
   * are not supported but week number form (`&quot;2009W52-7&quot;`) is supported. The canonical form (`&quot;2009-01-01T12:34:56.789&quot;`) will 
   * work as will any shortened subset of it (`&quot;2009-01-01&quot;`, `&quot;2009-01-01T12:34&quot;`, etc.). We've added a form for Quarter
   * granularity (`&quot;2009Q4&quot;`). Plus it will even parse strings in whatever custom granularity you provide based
   * upon the mask that you provide for that granularity.
   * 
   * If the granularity is specified but not all of the segments are provided, ChartTime will fill in the missing value 
   * with the `lowest` value from _granularitySpecs.
   * 
   * The Lumenize hierarchy tools rely upon the property that a single character is used between segments so the ISO forms that 
   * omit the delimiters are not supported.
   * 
   * If the string has a timezone indicator on the end (`...+05:00` or `...Z`), ChartTime will ignore it. Timezone information
   * is intended to only be used for comparison (see examples for timezone comparison).
   * 
   * There are two special Strings that are recognized: `BEFORE_FIRST` and `PAST_LAST`. You must provide a granularity if you
   * are instantiating a ChartTime with these values. They are primarily used for custom granularities where your users
   * may mistakenly request charts for iterations and releases that have not yet been defined. They are particularly useful when 
   * you want to iterate to the last defined iteration/release.
   * 
   * ## Rata Die Number ##
   * 
   * The **rata die number (RDN)** for a date is the number of days since 0001-01-01. You will probably never work
   * directly with this number but it's what ChartTime uses to convert between granularities. When you are instantiating
   * a ChartTime from an RDN, you must provide a granularity. Using RDN will work even for the granularities finer than day.
   * ChartTime will populate the finer grained segments (hour, minute, etc.) with the approriate `lowest` value.
   * 
   * ## Date ##
   * 
   * You can also pass in a JavaScript Date() Object. The passing in of a tz with this option doesn't make sense. You'll end
   * up with the same ChartTime value no matter what because the JS Date() already sorta has a timezone. I'm not sure if this
   * option is even really useful. In most cases, you are probably better off using ChartTime.getISOStringFromJSDate()
   * 
   * ## Spec ##
   * 
   * You can also explicitly spell out the segments in a **spec** Object in the form of 
   * `{granularity: ChartTime.DAY, year: 2009, month: 1, day: 1}`. If the granularity is specified but not all of the segments are
   * provided, ChartTime will fill in the missing value with the appropriate `lowest` value from _granularitySpecs.
   * 
   * ## granularity ##
   * 
   * If you provide a granularity it will take precedence over whatever fields you've provided in your spec or whatever segments
   * you have provided in your string. ChartTime will leave off extra values and fill in missing ones with the appropriate `lowest`
   * value.
   * 
   * ## tz ##
   * 
   * Most of the time, ChartTime assumes that any dates you pass in are timezone less. You'll specify Christmas as 12-25, then you'll
   * shift the boundaries of Christmas for a specific timezone for boundary comparison.
   * 
   * However, if you provide a tz parameter to this constructor, ChartTime will assume you are passing in a true GMT date/time and shift into 
   * the provided timezone. So...
   * 
   *     d = new ChartTime('2011-01-01T02:00:00:00.000Z', ChartTime.DAY, 'America/New_York')
   *     console.log(d.toString())
   *     # 2010-12-31
   *     
   * Rule of thumb on when you want to use timezones:
   * 
   * 1. If you have true GMT date/times and you want to create a ChartTime, provide the timezone to this constructor.
   * 2. If you have abstract days like Christmas or June 10th and you want to delay the timezone consideration, don't provide a timezone to this constructor.
   * 3. In either case, if the dates you want to compare to are in GMT, but you've got ChartTimes or ChartTimeRanges, you'll have to provide a timezone on
   *    the way back out of ChartTime/ChartTimeRange

  ###
  `_granularitySpecs` is a static object that is used to tell ChartTime what to do with particular granularties. You can think of
  each entry in it as a sort of sub-class of ChartTime. In that sense ChartTime is really a factory generating ChartTime objects
  of type granularity. When custom timebox granularities are added to ChartTime by `ChartTime.addGranularity()`, it adds to this
  `_granularitySpecs` object.

  Each entry in `_granularitySpecs` has the following:

  * segments - an Array identifying the ancestry (e.g. for 'day', it is: `['year', 'month', 'day']`)
  * mask - a String used to identify when this granularity is passed in and to serialize it on the way out.
  * lowest - the lowest possible value for this granularity. 0 for millisecond but 1 for day.
  * rolloverValue - a callback function that will say when to rollover the next coarser granularity.

     * 
     * The `mask` must cover all of the segments to get down to the granularity being specified. The digits of the granularity segments
     * are represented with `#`. Any other characters can be used as a delimeter, but it should always be one character to comply with 
     * the expectations of the Lumenize hierarchy visualizations. All of the standard granularities start with a 4-digit year to
     * distinguish your custom granularity, your highest level must start with some number of digits other than 4 or a prefix letter 
     * (`R` in the example above).
     * 
     * In order for the ChartTimeIterator to work, you must provide `rolloverValue` and `rataDieNumber` callback functions. You should
     * be able to mimic (or use as-is) the example above for most use cases. Notice how the `rataDieNumber` function simply leverages
     * `rataDieNumber` functions for the standard granularities.
     * 
     * In order to convert into this granularity from some other granularity, you must provide an `inGranularity` callback [NOT YET IMPLEMENTED].
     * But ChartTime will convert to any of the standard granularities from even custom granularities as long as a `rataDieNumber()` function
     * is provided.
     * 
     * **The `timeBoxes` propoerty in the `granularitySpec` Object above has no special meaning** to ChartTime or ChartTimeIterator. It's simply used
     * by the `rolloverValue` and `rataDieNumber` functions. The boundaries could come from where ever you want and even have been encoded as
     * literals in the `rolloverValue` and `rataDieNumber` callback functions.
     * 
     * The convention of naming the lowest order granularity with `_day` at the end IS signficant. ChartTime knows to treat that as a day-level
     * granularity. If there is a use-case for it, ChartTime could be upgraded to allow you to drill down into hours, minutes, etc. from any
     * `_day` granularity but right now those lower order time granularities are only supported for the canonical ISO-6801 form.
