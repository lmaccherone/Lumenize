   * 
   * __An efficient, in-memory, incrementally-updateable, hierarchy-capable OLAP Cube implementation.__
   * 
   * [OLAP Cubes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLAP_cube) are a powerful abstraction that makes it easier to do everything
   * from simple group-by operations to more complex multi-dimensional and hierarchical analysis. This implementation has
   * the same conceptual ancestry as implementations found in business intelligence and OLAP database solutions. However,
   * it is meant as a light weight alternative primarily targeting the goal of making it easier for developers to implement
   * desired analysis. It also supports serialization and incremental updating so it&#39;s ideally
   * suited for visualizations and analysis that are updated on a periodic or even continuous basis.
   * 
   * ## Features ##
   * 
   * * In-memory
   * * Incrementally-updateable
   * * Serialize (`getStateForSaving()`) and deserialize (`newFromSavedState()`) to preserve aggregations between sessions
   * * Accepts simple JavaScript Objects as facts
   * * Storage and output as simple JavaScript Arrays of Objects
   * * Hierarchy (trees) derived from fact data assuming [materialized path](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialized_path)
   *   array model commonly used with NoSQL databases
   * 
   * ## 2D Example ##
   * 
   * Let&#39;s walk through a simple 2D example from facts to output. Let&#39;s say you have this set of facts:
   * 
   *     facts = [
   *       {ProjectHierarchy: [1, 2, 3], Priority: 1, Points: 10},
   *       {ProjectHierarchy: [1, 2, 4], Priority: 2, Points: 5 },
   *       {ProjectHierarchy: [5]      , Priority: 1, Points: 17},
   *       {ProjectHierarchy: [1, 2]   , Priority: 1, Points: 3 },
   *     ]
   * 
   * The ProjectHierarchy field models its hierarchy (tree) as an array containing a
   * [materialized path](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialized_path). The first fact is &quot;in&quot; Project 3 whose parent is
   * Project 2, whose parent is Project 1. The second fact is &quot;in&quot; Project 4 whose parent is Project 2 which still has
   * Project 1 as its parent. Project 5 is another root Project like Project 1; and the fourth fact is &quot;in&quot; Project 2.
   * So the first fact will roll-up the tree and be aggregated against [1], and [1, 2] as well as [1, 2, 3]. Root Project 1
   * will get the data from all but the third fact which will get aggregated against root Project 5.
   * 
   * We specify the ProjectHierarchy field as a dimension of type &#39;hierarchy&#39; and the Priorty field as a simple value dimension.
   * 
   *     dimensions = [
   *       {field: &quot;ProjectHierarchy&quot;, type: &#39;hierarchy&#39;},
   *       {field: &quot;Priority&quot;}
   *     ]
   * 
   * This will create a 2D &quot;cube&quot; where each unique value for ProjectHierarchy and Priority defines a different cell.
   * Note, this happens to be a 2D &quot;cube&quot; (more commonly referred to as a [pivot table](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivot_Table)),
   * but you can also have a 1D cube (a simple group-by), a 3D cube, or even an n-dimensional hypercube where n is greater than 3.
   * 
   * You can specify any number of metrics to be calculated for each cell in the cube.
   * 
   *     metrics = [
   *       {field: &quot;Points&quot;, f: &quot;sum&quot;, as: &quot;Scope&quot;}
   *     ]
   * 
   * You can use any of the aggregation functions found in Lumenize.functions except `count`. The count metric is
   * automatically tracked for each cell. The `as` specification is optional unless you provide a custom function. If missing,
   * it will build the name of the resulting metric from the field name and the function. So without the `as: &quot;Scope&quot;` the
   * second metric in the example above would have been named &quot;Points_sum&quot;.
   * 
   * You can also use custom functions in the form of `f(values) -&gt; return &lt;some function of values&gt;`.
   * 
   * Next, we build the config parameter from our dimension and metrics specifications.
   * 
   *     config = {dimensions, metrics}
   * 
   * Hierarchy dimensions automatically roll up but you can also tell it to keep all totals by setting config.keepTotals to
   * true. The totals are then kept in the cells where one or more of the dimension values are set to `null`. Note, you
   * can also set keepTotals for individual dimension and should probably use that if you have more than a few dimensions
   * but we&#39;re going to set it globally here:
   * 
   *     config.keepTotals = true
   * 
   * Now, let&#39;s create the cube.
   * 
   *     {OLAPCube} = require(&#39;../&#39;)
   *     cube = new OLAPCube(config, facts)
   * 
   * `getCell()` allows you to extract a single cell. The &quot;total&quot; cell for all facts where Priority = 1 can be found as follows:
   * 
   *     console.log(cube.getCell({Priority: 1}))
   *     # { ProjectHierarchy: null, Priority: 1, _count: 3, Scope: 30 }
   * 
   * Notice how the ProjectHierarchy field value is `null`. This is because it is a total cell for Priority dimension
   * for all ProjectHierarchy values. Think of `null` values in this context as wildcards.
   * 
   * Similarly, we can get the total for all descendants of ProjectHierarchy = [1] regarless of Priority as follows:
   * 
   *     console.log(cube.getCell({ProjectHierarchy: [1]}))
   *     # { ProjectHierarchy: [ 1 ], Priority: null, _count: 3, Scope: 18 }
   * 
   * `getCell()` uses the cellIndex so it&#39;s very efficient. Using `getCell()` and `getDimensionValues()`, you can iterate
   * over a slice of the OLAPCube. It is usually preferable to access the cells in place like this rather than the
   * traditional OLAP approach of extracting a slice for processing.
   * 
   *     rowValues = cube.getDimensionValues(&#39;ProjectHierarchy&#39;)
   *     columnValues = cube.getDimensionValues(&#39;Priority&#39;)
   *     s = OLAPCube._padToWidth(&#39;&#39;, 7) + &#39; | &#39;
   *     s += ((OLAPCube._padToWidth(JSON.stringify(c), 7) for c in columnValues).join(&#39; | &#39;))
   *     s += &#39; | &#39;
   *     console.log(s)
   *     for r in rowValues
   *       s = OLAPCube._padToWidth(JSON.stringify(r), 7) + &#39; | &#39;
   *       for c in columnValues
   *         cell = cube.getCell({ProjectHierarchy: r, Priority: c})
   *         if cell?
   *           cellString = JSON.stringify(cell._count)
   *         else
   *           cellString = &#39;&#39;
   *         s += OLAPCube._padToWidth(cellString, 7) + &#39; | &#39;
   *       console.log(s)
   *     #         |    null |       1 |       2 |
   *     #    null |       4 |       3 |       1 |
   *     #     [1] |       3 |       2 |       1 |
   *     #   [1,2] |       3 |       2 |       1 |
   *     # [1,2,3] |       1 |       1 |         |
   *     # [1,2,4] |       1 |         |       1 |
   *     #     [5] |       1 |       1 |         |
   * 
   * Or you can just call `toString()` method which extracts a 2D slice for tabular display. Both approachs will work on
   * cubes of any number of dimensions two or greater. The manual example above extracted the `count` metric. We&#39;ll tell
   * the example below to extract the `Scope` metric.
   * 
   *     console.log(cube.toString(&#39;ProjectHierarchy&#39;, &#39;Priority&#39;, &#39;Scope&#39;))
   *     # |        || Total |     1     2|
   *     # |==============================|
   *     # |Total   ||    35 |    30     5|
   *     # |------------------------------|
   *     # |[1]     ||    18 |    13     5|
   *     # |[1,2]   ||    18 |    13     5|
   *     # |[1,2,3] ||    10 |    10      |
   *     # |[1,2,4] ||     5 |           5|
   *     # |[5]     ||    17 |    17      |
   * 
   * ## Dimension types ##
   * 
   * The following dimension types are supported:
   * 
   * 1. Single value
   *    * Number
   *    * String
   *    * Does not work:
   *      * Boolean - known to fail
   *      * Object - may sorta work but sort-order at least is not obvious
   *      * Date - not tested but may actually work
   * 2. Arrays as materialized path for hierarchical (tree) data
   * 3. Non-hierarchical Arrays (&quot;tags&quot;)
   * 
   * There is no need to tell the OLAPCube what type to use with the exception of #2. In that case, add `type: &#39;hierarchy&#39;`
   * to the dimensions row like this:
   * 
   *     dimensions = [
   *       {field: &#39;hierarchicalDimensionField&#39;, type: &#39;hierarchy&#39;} #, ...
   *     ]
   * 
   * ## Hierarchical (tree) data ##
   * 
   * This OLAP Cube implementation assumes your hierarchies (trees) are modeled as a
   * [materialized path](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialized_path) array. This approach is commonly used with NoSQL databases like
   * [CouchDB](http://probablyprogramming.com/2008/07/04/storing-hierarchical-data-in-couchdb) and
   * [MongoDB (combining materialized path and array of ancestors)](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/model-tree-structures/)
   * and even SQL databases supporting array types like [Postgres](http://justcramer.com/2012/04/08/using-arrays-as-materialized-paths-in-postgres/).
   * 
   * This approach differs from the traditional OLAP/MDX fixed/named level hierarchy approach. In that approach, you assume
   * that the number of levels in the hierarchy are fixed. Also, each level in the hierarchy is either represented by a different
   * column (clothing example --&gt; level 0: SEX column - mens vs womens; level 1: TYPE column - pants vs shorts vs shirts; etc.) or
   * predetermined ranges of values in a single field (date example --&gt; level 0: year; level 1: quarter; level 2: month; etc.)
   * 
   * However, the approach used by this OLAPCube implementaion is the more general case, because it can easily simulate
   * fixed/named level hierachies whereas the reverse is not true. In the clothing example above, you would simply key
   * your dimension off of a derived field that was a combination of the SEX and TYPE columns (e.g. [&#39;mens&#39;, &#39;pants&#39;])
   * 
   * ## Date/Time hierarchies ##
   * 
   * Lumenize is designed to work well with the tzTime library. Here is an example of taking a bunch of ISOString data
   * and doing timezone precise hierarchical roll up based upon the date segments (year, month).
   * 
   *     data = [
   *       {date: &#39;2011-12-31T12:34:56.789Z&#39;, value: 10},
   *       {date: &#39;2012-01-05T12:34:56.789Z&#39;, value: 20},
   *       {date: &#39;2012-01-15T12:34:56.789Z&#39;, value: 30},
   *       {date: &#39;2012-02-01T00:00:01.000Z&#39;, value: 40},
   *       {date: &#39;2012-02-15T12:34:56.789Z&#39;, value: 50},
   *     ]
   * 
   *     {Time} = require(&#39;../&#39;)
   * 
   *     config =
   *       deriveFieldsOnInput: [{
   *         field: &#39;dateSegments&#39;,
   *         f: (row) -&gt;
   *           return new Time(row.date, Time.MONTH, &#39;America/New_York&#39;).getSegmentsAsArray()
   *       }]
   *       metrics: [{field: &#39;value&#39;, f: &#39;sum&#39;}]
   *       dimensions: [{field: &#39;dateSegments&#39;, type: &#39;hierarchy&#39;}]
   * 
   *     cube = new OLAPCube(config, data)
   *     console.log(cube.toString(undefined, undefined, &#39;value_sum&#39;))
   *     # | dateSegments | value_sum |
   *     # |==========================|
   *     # | [2011]       |        10 |
   *     # | [2011,12]    |        10 |
   *     # | [2012]       |       140 |
   *     # | [2012,1]     |        90 |
   *     # | [2012,2]     |        50 |
   * 
   * Notice how &#39;2012-02-01T00:00:01.000Z&#39; got bucketed in January because the calculation was done in timezone
   * &#39;America/New_York&#39;.
   * 
   * ## Non-hierarchical Array fields ##
   * 
   * If you don&#39;t specify type: &#39;hierarchy&#39; and the OLAPCube sees a field whose value is an Array in a dimension field, the
   * data in that fact would get aggregated against each element in the Array. So a non-hierarchical Array field like
   * [&#39;x&#39;, &#39;y&#39;, &#39;z&#39;] would get aggregated against &#39;x&#39;, &#39;y&#39;, and &#39;z&#39; rather than [&#39;x&#39;], [&#39;x&#39;, &#39;y&#39;], and [&#39;x&#39;,&#39;y&#39;,&#39;z]. This
   * functionality is useful for  accomplishing analytics on tags, but it can be used in other powerful ways. For instance
   * let&#39;s say you have a list of events:
   * 
   *     events = [
   *       {name: &#39;Renaissance Festival&#39;, activeMonths: [&#39;September&#39;, &#39;October&#39;]},
   *       {name: &#39;Concert Series&#39;, activeMonths: [&#39;July&#39;, &#39;August&#39;, &#39;September&#39;]},
   *       {name: &#39;Fall Festival&#39;, activeMonths: [&#39;September&#39;]}
   *     ]
   * 
   * You could figure out the number of events active in each month by specifying &quot;activeMonths&quot; as a dimension.
   * Lumenize.TimeInStateCalculator (and other calculators in Lumenize) use this technique.
   * 
   * @constructor
   * @param {Object} config See Config options for details. DO NOT change the config settings after the OLAP class is instantiated.
   * @param {Object[]} [facts] Optional parameter allowing the population of the OLAPCube with an intitial set of facts
   *   upon instantiation. Use addFacts() to add facts after instantiation.
   * @cfg {Object[]} dimensions Array which specifies the fields to use as dimension fields. If the field contains a
   *   hierarchy array, say so in the row, (e.g. `{field: &#39;SomeFieldName&#39;, type: &#39;hierarchy&#39;}`). Any array values that it
   *   finds in the supplied facts will be assumed to be tags rather than a hierarchy specification unless `type: &#39;hierarchy&#39;`
   *   is specified.
   * 
   *   For example, let&#39;s say you have a set of facts that look like this:
   * 
   *     fact = {
   *       dimensionField: &#39;a&#39;,
   *       hierarchicalDimensionField: [&#39;1&#39;,&#39;2&#39;,&#39;3&#39;],
   *       tagDimensionField: [&#39;x&#39;, &#39;y&#39;, &#39;z&#39;],
   *       valueField: 10
   *     }
   * 
   *   Then a set of dimensions like this makes sense.
   * 
   *     config.dimensions = [
   *       {field: &#39;dimensionField&#39;},
   *       {field: &#39;hierarchicalDimensionField&#39;, type: &#39;hierarchy&#39;},
   *       {field: &#39;tagDimensionField&#39;, keepTotals: true}
   *     ]
   * 
   *   Notice how a keepTotals can be set for an individual dimension. This is preferable to setting it for the entire
   *   cube in cases where you don&#39;t want totals in all dimensions.
   * 
   * @cfg {Object[]} [metrics=[]] Array which specifies the metrics to calculate for each cell in the cube.
   * 
   *   Example:
   * 
   *     config = {}
   *     config.metrics = [
   *       {field: &#39;field3&#39;},                                      # defaults to metrics: [&#39;sum&#39;]
   *       {field: &#39;field4&#39;, metrics: [
   *         {f: &#39;sum&#39;},                                           # will add a metric named field4_sum
   *         {as: &#39;median4&#39;, f: &#39;p50&#39;},                            # renamed p50 to median4 from default of field4_p50
   *         {as: &#39;myCount&#39;, f: (values) -&gt; return values.length}  # user-supplied function
   *       ]}
   *     ]
   * 
   *   If you specify a field without any metrics, it will assume you want the sum but it will not automatically
   *   add the sum metric to fields with a metrics specification. User-supplied aggregation functions are also supported as
   *   shown in the &#39;myCount&#39; metric above.
   * 
   *   Note, if the metric has dependencies (e.g. average depends upon count and sum) it will automatically add those to
   *   your metric definition. If you&#39;ve already added a dependency but put it under a different &quot;as&quot;, it&#39;s not smart
   *   enough to sense that and it will add it again. Either live with the slight inefficiency and duplication or leave
   *   dependency metrics named their default by not providing an &quot;as&quot; field.
   * 
   * @cfg {Boolean} [keepTotals=false] Setting this will add an additional total row (indicated with field: null) along
   *   all dimensions. This setting can have an impact on the memory usage and performance of the OLAPCube so
   *   if things are tight, only use it if you really need it. If you don&#39;t need it for all dimension, you can specify
   *   keepTotals for individual dimensions.
   * @cfg {Boolean} [keepFacts=false] Setting this will cause the OLAPCube to keep track of the facts that contributed to
   *   the metrics for each cell by adding an automatic &#39;facts&#39; metric. Note, facts are restored after deserialization
   *   as you would expect, but they are no longer tied to the original facts. This feature, especially after a restore
   *   can eat up memory.
   * @cfg {Object[]} [deriveFieldsOnInput] An Array of Maps in the form `{field:&#39;myField&#39;, f:(fact)-&gt;...}`
   * @cfg {Object[]} [deriveFieldsOnOutput] same format as deriveFieldsOnInput, except the callback is in the form `f(row)`
   *   This is only called for dirty rows that were effected by the latest round of addFacts. It&#39;s more efficient to calculate things
   *   like standard deviation and percentile coverage here than in config.metrics. You just have to remember to include the dependencies
   *   in config.metrics. Standard deviation depends upon `sum` and `sumSquares`. Percentile coverage depends upon `values`.
   *   In fact, if you are going to capture values anyway, all of the functions are most efficiently calculated here.
   *   Maybe some day, I&#39;ll write the code to analyze your metrics and move them out to here if it improves efficiency.
